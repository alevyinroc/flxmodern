I want to build a new theme for my Hugo powered blog.

I want the appearance to:
    *Clean and modern
    *Simple
    *Have dark and light modes
    *Have clean typography

Navigation:
    Hierarchical menus in a navigation bar

Page dimensions:
    *The total width should be 90 percent of the viewport
    *The main page, and index pages for each category, will have:
        *A main column that's 75% of the content space
        *A sidebar that's 20% of the content space.
        
It should have space in the header for a logo image as well as site title and subtitle. The template for individual blog posts should support multiple authors, and there will be more than one author across the whole site so there need to be pages for authors. The main pages of the site should display the beginning of 10 blog posts at a time and be paginated, similar to how the current flxsql.com renders. Each blog post page should also support comments from the disqus service. I don’t want to use any external resources if at all possible (so, only self-hosted fonts and libraries). Can you start building that? Call it "flxmodern" and place it in the local path /home/andy/code/themes/flxmodern

This exampleSite demonstrates how to use the `flxmodern` theme.

Quick start

1. Copy the contents of this `exampleSite/config.toml` into your site's `config.toml`, or use the theme as shown.
2. The theme supports a `params.recentPosts` integer to control the number of recent posts shown in the sidebar (default 5).

To preview the example site locally:

```bash
hugo server -s exampleSite -D --disableFastRender
```

The `content/` folder includes sample posts and an author page so the demo renders immediately.
